Our goal simplified,
“Injection signifies Medicinal Vaccines giving life to many hearts”

# Problem Statement
There are a lot of people who die unknowingly because of a disease that could have been preventable. The problem is that there is not anyone reliable source to look up to regarding diseases and their vaccines. We plan to provide a reliable database of vaccines and all the human trials happening all over India. A person can search for vaccines by age limit or by disease and poor people if willing may take part in human trials of various vaccines which allows them to get vaccinated, get medical attention, and also contributes to the development of Indian vaccinations.

# Problem Solved
There are various health issues to which a solution has not been provided yet and , some problem arises due to having incomplete information or no information to the people resulting in taking the wrong medications relying on local chemists many-a times. Addition to that, existence of various vaccines and medicines is not even marked on the internet. It divides people into two categories, one who don't know about the vaccines  and the other who has to visit different hospitals to take updates on them which we think is a sign of not using digital technology efficiently.

# Problem Solution
We are striving to provide a solution by building a robust and dependable database that displays all the required health information on our website. Upon visiting the website, users will be prompted to select their role as a patient or a doctor, and the login page will be provided accordingly. Patients will have access to various services listed under the services tab, and they will be regularly informed about updated clinical trials through the notices tab. Additionally, the website will ensure age restrictions are taken into account and display relevant vaccines based on the patient's age.The doctor will be able to update notices and information on the portal .

# Objective
At Mediconnect, our primary objective is to provide a centralized database of all vaccines available in India, offering crucial information such as the diseases they prevent and any age restrictions associated with their administration. We aim to ensure that individuals and healthcare providers have easy access to accurate and up-to-date vaccine information, helping them make informed decisions regarding immunization.
